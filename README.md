# Unit testing examples

These are some examples for unit testing with JUnit for the course OOAD at the University College of Borås, Sweden.

Just clone the repo and you should be good to go, as long as you're using netbeans.
The netbeans project is located in the JUnitExamples directory.

	$ git clone git@github.com:eriksk/UnitTesting.git

The 2011 directory contains examples from last year. Feel free to have a look.
